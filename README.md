Tips and Tricks for developing with Cantera

## How to work with this repo

Please edit this README file with the tips and tricks that you come up with. As we collect information, we'll try to organize it in a useful way, but we didn't want to impose some organization beforehand. Please try to put your tips into header sections.

Please make your changes in a branch and make a pull request to add it to `master`. You will not be able to fork this repository to your own account (since this is a private repository), so you will be making branches on this repository. Otherwise, the workflow is basically the same as with a forked repository.
